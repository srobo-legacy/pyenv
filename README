pyenv
-----

pyenv is an environment within which Student Robotics robot code is
executed.

There are a number of external repositories from which the binaries in
this repository are constructed:

 * libkoki: https://www.studentrobotics.org/cgit/libkoki.git
 * firmware blobs: From various SR boards.
 * Other libraries: The libraries in pyenv/lib are mainly from the SR
   openembedded tree.

When compiling replacement firmware or other libraries which will be included
as binaries, note that these need to be compiled to target the SR kit.
In general, this means that they should be compiled in the SR openembedded
tree's build environment.

Patches
-------

This project is managed/maintained by Rob Spanton
<rspanton@zepler.net>, but rather than emailing him, email the Student
Robotics development mailing list <srobo-devel@googlegroups.com>.

Send patches in the following ways:

 * Send an email with the patches attached.  Generate these patches
   with git-format-patch so that they include a commit message,
   committer etc.  Include both "[PATCH]" and "[pyenv]" in the subject
   line of the email.

 * Send a pull-request email to srobo-devel with "[pyenv]" and
   "[pull-request]" in the subject line along with the *git URL* and
   *branch name* (not some link to a gitorious or github webpage --
   digging around in those websites for the git URLs is time
   consuming and boring).

Things to avoid:

 * Merging in branches from other people, who've already sent their
   patches or pull-request to the maintainer.  *Especially* when
   the patches of the other person are unrelated to your work.

 * Assuming that your patches will enter into the repository without
   being modified (applies to pull-requests as well as patch sets)
